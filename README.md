# Exam 1

welcome! Your job is to complete all the function definitions mentioned in the three problem set files such that they meet the state requirements:

- `problem_set_1.py`
- `problem_set_2.py`
- `problem_set_3.py`

To run the program, run the file named [main.py](./main.py).

## Clone this repository

First, clone this repository to your local computer, using Visual Studio Code's cloning feature.

## Set up Visual Studio Code

Once cloned, set Visual Studio Code to be suitable for Python development using the "command palette":

- set the interpreter to a Python 3.x interpreter, such as that by [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/).
- set the linter to by `pylint`.
- set the test framework to be `pytest`.

### Run the program

To run the program, run the file named `main.py`. This file calls one function from each of the problem sets. Feel free to comment/uncomment any code in this file or add additional code. This file is meant to help you get your code in the other files working, and will not itself be graded.

### Verify that the tests pass

Pytest-based tests are included in the `tests` directory that will help you determine whether each function is operating as expected. If the functions have been completed correctly, all tests should pass. You should not modify any files in the `test` directory.
